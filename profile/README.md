# Götebordle [WIP]

> Götebordle is an unnoficial game and is not associated with Västtrafik

Götebordle is a Wordle-style game where you have to guess the daily stop of the Gothenburg tram. The project is developed by a group of friends from Gothenburg 💙

The project is under active development, for any feature suggestions, bug reports, or collaborations, reach out to us at info@goteborgdle.se
